    // MARK: performRequest - entry point for request
    /**
    performRequest is the meat of the service. It is where all requests to the service come in.

    The request parameter will contain all information the caller has provided for the request, this will include the URL,
    the HTTP Method, and in the case of a POST or PUT, any HTTP body data.
    The nature of services are asynchronous. So this method has no return values, it communicates with its caller through three
    blocks or closures. These three are the parameters responseReturn, dataReturn, and requestComplete. This follows the general
    nature of a web-based HTTP interaction.

    - parameters:
    - responseReturn    : generally every call to performRequest should call responseReturn once, and only once. The call requires an
    NSHTTPResponse object, and a default object is provided as the "response" parameter. The response object can be returned directly,
    or can be used as a container for default values, and a new NSHTTPResponse can be built from it. The default response parameter's
    status code is 200 (OK), so error conditions will not return the response object unaltered. (See the respondWithErrorStatus methods,
    and the createResponse method documentation below for helpers in creating other response objects.)

    - dataReturn        : Services that return data, and not just a status code will use the dataReturn parameter to return data. Generally
    this block will be called once, however it could be called multiple times to return particularly large amounts of data in a
    chunked fashion. Again, this behavior follows general web-based HTTP interaction. If used, the dataReturn block should be called after
    the responseReturn block is called, and before the responseComplete block is called.

    - requstComplete    : this block indicates to the caller that the service has completed processing, and the call is complete. The requestComplete
    block must be called, and it must be called only once per performRequest call. Once the requestComplete block is called, no additional
    processing should happen in the service, and no other blocks should be called.

        /// we'll use a guard statement here just to verify the request object is valid. The HTTPMethod and URL properties of a NSURLRequest
        /// are optional, and we need to ensure we're dealing with a request that contains them.

            /**
            if the request does not contain a URL or a HTTPMethod, then we return a error. We'll also return an error if the URL
            does not contain a path. In a normal interaction this would never happen, but we need to be defensive and expect anything.

            we'll use one of the respondWithErrorStatus methods to return an error condition to the caller, in this case,
            a status code of 400 (Bad Request).

            Note that the respondWithErrorStatus methods all take the response object, the reponseReturn block and the requestComplete
            block. This is because the respondWithErrorStatus constructs an appropriate NSHTTPURLResponse object, and calls
            the reponseReturn and requestComplete blocks for you. Once a respondWithErrorStatus method is called, the performRequest
            method should not continue processing and should always return.
